# random-quote-generator
In this project, I created an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. I selected my own quotes from famous movies. 

I used my growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to:
• Build an array of quote objects to store the quotes.
• Write my own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
